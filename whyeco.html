        This was the very first project that I ever did at University, and was actually my first 'summative' 
        assessment. The briefing was fairly open-ended and we were required to make an 'infomericial' to inform 
        people who haven't done economics before why they should take economics and the benefits behind them.

        Within this project, I learnt how to work with a team of people; which at the time were unfamiliar, 
        how to create deadlines for my teammates and enhance my video editing skills (in iMovie) with limited time 
        and lack of access to Final Cut Pro X.
