      <h3 style = text-align:center>Objective - Document a macroeconomic event</h3>
      <br>
      <h3 style = text-align:center>This was an essay written by a group of 6 (where I mainly directed and lead the 
        team) and we discussed the local multiplier effect on London in 2012. We chose to do London at this time as 
        we wanted to find out the effects that the Olympics had and if it impacted on consumption and the local 
        economy in a certain way. We applied content that we learn from class, such as: the Keynesian Cross Model 
        and considering how endogenous and exogenous effects impacted on London's GDP. </h3>
      <br>
      <h3 style = text-align:center>Overall, I am very proud of my group and the essay we produced as we made 
        significant improvements (in terms of the team's synergy and quality of content produced). 
        Take a read of what we produced below, I hope you enjoy it!</h3>

        Is it right for primary school-aged children to be taught financial education in schools? Well, here is my 
        answer. In my opinion, I think it is absolutely crucial that children at this age get the knowledge of 
        understanding how to use their money wisely; as the younger they learn, the more they are able to naturally 
        adapt into real-life situations when they are older.

      <br>
      <div class="container", style = text-align:center>
        The multiplier is a key concept in all economies, allowing economic growth to benefit economies further. 
        The multiplier effect is defined as how an injection in the circular flow of income creates a proportionately 
        larger increase in aggregate demand. Zooming into a local view, maximising this and all its components can 
        really propel a local economy forward. We focus on the city of London and the impacts of the 2012 Olympics. 
        Evaluating through the benefits and drawbacks of maximising the local multiplier effect, encompassing both 
        the theoretically assumed effects and the realistic effects that were seen, we'll reach a balanced verdict 
        on the impacts of the Local Multiplier Effect.

        From a theoretical standpoint, heightened domestic investment and foreign direct investment increases demand 
        for the GBP, causing it to appreciate against its competitors' currencies. As such, imports could become 
        cheaper to domestic consumers, signalling an increase in the marginal propensity to import. Increased money 
        demand brings a greater flow of income into the economy and a higher marginal propensity to consume. Domestic 
        consumers may have more disposable income, increasing aggregate demand as well. From the time that the games 
        were given to the UK, investors were attracted to the possible profits of owning assets in London due to the 
        anticipated increased growth rate of national income and consumption. This could lead to an increased demand 
        for capital goods and labour to increase capacity. Investors wanting to benefit from the positive outlook of 
        growth for the UK economy would be incentivised to shift over to London, pushing forth what is known as the 
        accelerator effect.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        The increased development would improve infrastructure, making the area more attractive to even more investors 
        and consumers, continuing the cycle. Government expenditure (G) increases to finance its own investment into 
        building new facilities for example, and greater employment raises output. The inflow of tourists and investors
         would raise exports and despite elevated imports, the overall net effect would be an increase in exports, 
         benefiting the economy. These components all influence and grow from each other, enhancing the local 
         multiplier effect.Investment-led multipliers could mean that firms have greater capital to invest in 
         development projects; this could include investment in new brick-and-mortar stores. New stores could 
         benefit locals as they need employment for construction and business operations. This helps increase 
         local disposable incomes which helps to increase aggregate demand and decrease unemployment, this causes
         a shift upwards in AE1 to AE2, which creates a higher equilibrium income from output Y1 to Y2. Going further 
         with this benefit, an increase in income will create greater tax revenue (t) which can allow for greater 
         government expenditure without negatively affecting the national debt. The effectiveness of this theory 
         depends on how high the tax rate is, as they are positively correlated.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        Looking back at the aftermath of hosting the Olympics in 2012, London significantly benefitted economically. 
        The construction, maintenance and running of the London Stadium (now known as West Ham's home stadium) 'led 
        to more than 31,000 jobs being created' as stated on GOV.UK (2013) [F]. This increased productivity and 
        national output as the economy moved close to full employment and capacity. The new workers received wages, 
        which boosted income and increased domestic consumption, which is a component of AD, and so we see an outward 
        shift of the AD curve displaying short-term economic growth.

      <div class="container">
        Furthermore, Stratford was considered a majorly deprived area in London prior to 2012, as commented by Sampson 
        (2011) '...the Games would be a force for regeneration and [they] would transform one of the poorest and most 
        deprived areas of London' [J]. Therefore, the International Olympic Committee agreed this would be a great 
        opportunity for redevelopment. The crime rate initially decreased, and Stratford was perceived more positively 
        (Faggio, 2019) [E].
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        Since the Olympics ended, the facilities are available to the public, including swimming pools, a BMX pump 
        track, and the velodrome – attracting tourists to Stratford, who spent money (which wasn't previously in the 
        UK's circular flow) on food, memorabilia, transport, and other services, causing an export-led multiplier, 
        further increasing AD and economic growth. The locals benefitted too, including schools who hired pools for 
        swimming lessons.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        The redevelopment led to a disproportionately high rise in Stratford house values compared to the rest of 
        London between 2005 and 2015 (Bloomfield, 2016) [C]. This benefitted current property owners as they're able 
        to charge a higher fee for their properties. Also, it may lead to a positive wealth effect, which is when 
        consumers spend more when their assets rise in value, contributing to a larger multiplier effect and in turn 
        benefitting local businesses as their products are being bought more, increasing profits. Additionally, 2,818 
        affordable homes were built and there were vast improvements to local transport links benefitting the public 
        (Study Rocket, 2019) [I].

        Negative impacts of the multiplier:
        </div></b>
        <br>
      <div class="container">
        Conversely, the multiplier can have negative impacts. Government expenditure initially used for the 
        investment is funded by taxing households and businesses. This reduces households' disposable incomes 
        and firm profits. This means that households and firms might be financially worse off; if consumers have 
        lower real incomes, then consumption will fall, and the AD rise will be limited. Additionally, if G is 
        financed by borrowing then this may lead to crowding out whereby interest rates rise, increasing the cost 
        of borrowing for firms and reducing private-sector investment (Boyes, 2014) [D].
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        Another drawback of the local multiplier is if government expenditure is imposed to initiate the effect, 
        then the government would be running a budget deficit which is unsustainable and could lead to over 
        indebtedness. If government expenditure is more than what they earn from tax revenues, this could worsen 
        the public sector net cash requirement (PSNCR). As national debt accumulates over time, it could lead to a 
        fiscal crisis whereby the government cannot afford to provide welfare payments or healthcare as it must pay 
        off the debt.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        Furthermore, allowing the government to spend more money than it generates through revenue, a budget deficit, 
        the PSNCR, must be financed by public sector borrowing. If the borrowing is excessive, however, it could be 
        quite detrimental. This is because demand-pull inflation may arise from excessive borrowing. The cause of 
        demand-pull inflation is often excessive growth in aggregate demand relative to supply. High consumer spending 
        is also a potential cause. Borrowing excessively could create demand-pull inflation partly because government 
        borrowing raises the money supply, resulting in a greater quantity of money in the economy than can be matched 
        by output. If money supply is growing at a faster rate compared to output, this means that the rise in money 
        circulating through the economy is greater than the increase in goods produced. There is effectively now more 
        money chasing fewer goods in the economy and so naturally this can lead to a rise in goods prices.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        If demand-pull inflation is brought on by potential excessive borrowing, it can then lead to a rise in interest
        rates, which is a strategy used to lower aggregate demand which will then halt that rise in inflation. However, 
        increased interest rates will discourage investment by firms and make the country's currency rise in value, 
        making its exports less price competitive, which is clearly not desirable. Moreover, a continuing budget 
        deficit means that in the long-run, future generations will have to pay for the current spending and are 
        likely to be faced with higher tax rates to pay the debt which means economic growth may be lower in the 
        future. (Aliabadi, Dorestani, and Abdyldaeva, 2011) [B]
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        This in fact happened in London: a large injection of government spending was allocated towards the 
        development of the Olympic Park. Overmyer M (2017) states that 'the final cost for the city and UK was 
        extremely high… money used may have been better utilised [in] refining social programs, improving general 
        infrastructure or in decreasing the number of homeless' [H]. Expenditure in unnecessary areas can be viewed 
        as economically inefficient as there are no improvements or progressions towards the government's macroeconomic 
        objectives; further creating an opportunity cost: 'it is common for central governments to expand massive 
        amount[s] of capital in preparation for the games… however in place of spending of health care, education and 
        welfare, an opportunity cost is always present' [A]. The government needs a source to fund the injection, and 
        this can be done through borrowing (PSCNR). This could worsen the economy as increasing public sector spending 
        typically disincentivises private investment as interest rates rise, which decreases animal spirits. Liu D et 
        al. states that 'the crowding out effect is particularly relevant when considering major events' [G]. By 
        having a reduction in private sector investment, we will see a fall in AD; and this can be seen 
        diagrammatically: initial injection of G causes the AE line to shift to AE1. Assuming the government 
        borrows through the PSNCR, the effect of increasing interest rates will likely reduce private investments 
        as business confidence will fall, which (depending on the magnitude of the decrease in I) will reduce AE1 to
        AE2. Therefore, the overall effect of the multiplier may be less beneficial as we initially see it due to the 
        negative feedback that we see from the injection.

      <b><div class="container", style = text-align:center>
        Further Discussion:
        </div></b>
        <br>
      <div class="container">
        Overall, we saw that the multiplier typically led to net benefits as it helped to attract further investment 
        and, in the case of the Olympics, brought in more tourism. The 'Olympic city improved country citizen pride 
        and led to long-term increases in tourism and foreign direct investment' [H]. General infrastructure in the 
        area such as: The West Ham Stadium, the Athletes' village and the ArcelorMittal Orbit became future profits 
        which 'achieved the economies of scale required to gain a return on these significant investments into 
        infrastructure, transportation and community development' [H]. Attracting development improved living 
        standards and brought more investors into the area: there was higher confidence in the area compared to 
        others as the park's historical statistics of revenue and footfall were higher.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="container">
        To add, the multiplier effect could be improved through reducing taxation/manipulating interest rates to 
        stimulate consumption (through using expansionary fiscal/monetary policy) instead of using G. With the 
        increase of C, output will naturally increase, and this may incentivise investment as they see potential 
        in the area which could help with the development of the park, whilst also mitigating risks of government 
        debt worsening. Alesina A. et al have stated that 'Fiscal stimuli based on tax cuts are more likely to 
        increase growth than those based on spending increases' [H]. Utilising tax cuts/lowering r could also prevent 
        demand-pull inflation from worsening as the government have much more control over setting these rates, 
        instead of ambiguously increasing government spending to reach desired output: 'governments imposing taxes 
        to specifically financing Olympic costs… will fare far better than those that do not.' [H].

        Conclusion
      </div></b>
      <br>
      <div class="container">
        Ultimately, we saw with the 2012 London Olympics, that the multiplier produced an overall positive effect. 
        The multiplier essentially kickstarted dynamic development as the initial attraction gained from the games 
        helped to bring in more investment and increased business confidence in the general area. For that reason, 
        we believe that the beneficial effects outweigh any of the negative impacts which may occur over the long term:
        there will be a constant development of infrastructure through further investment and development, which would 
        have been an unlikely outcome without the initial decade-old investments.
