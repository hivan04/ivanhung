      <h2 style = text-align:center>First Three-Statement Model - Built from Scratch w/Tutorial 
      (11.04 - 13.04.24)</h2><br>
      <div class="container">
        With minimal accounting experience, completing this Three-Statement Model from Wall Street Prep was found to, initially, be quite challenging as I was trying to connect the dots between financials in balance sheet and cash flow statements. However, in completing this model, I found myself loving Excel even more as I improved my keyboard shortcut proficiency, found how this simple yet powerful model can help with forecasting, be further developed to find the intrinsic value of a company and analyse the cost & benefits of buying out a company with leverage; i.e. complement an LBO model.

      <div class="container">
        Learning about the Revolver 'balancing' tool (which I found was used to ensure that Cash and Equivalents don't fall below 0) was my favourite part about building the model as it was the ultimate thing that was mentioned in the video which tied everything together very nicely!
