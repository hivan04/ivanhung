            <h2>UEA's TEA (Transforming Education Awards) (09.05.24):</h2>
            <p>
            This event was relaunched for the first time post-COVID and was a fascinating evening! There was a warm atmosphere with plenty of 
            food and drinks available and I had the opportunity to attend this event as I was shortlisted for two events!
            One was for being the best academic rep of the year and other was for best contribution to the school.
            I was fortunate to win best academic rep of the year and I am so grateful that my School took 4/7 awards back home! 
            I am so proud to be part of the school and ECOs constant contributions to making our community better everyday!

            <h2>First in-person interview! (03.04.24):</h2>
            <p>
                After some rigorous rounds of the application process, I had the opportunity to have an in-person with this company (which I will not disclose) 
                where I created a presentation prior about a personal experience on development and had a behavioural interview afterwards. It was a thoroughly 
                enjoyable experience and I cannot thank the company enough for allowing to have the chance to visit them.
            </p>
            <p>
                All went well, however, their vacancies were full and so at this time I wasn't offered a position as a summer analyst, however, 
                I was shortlisted! Despite not getting a spot, I have decided to journal this experience as it was the first time that I ever did an
                interview for an internship in-person.

            <h2>NM Finance - Property Developer Series (08.02.24):</h2>
            <p>
                Today I attended a property developer event hosted by NM finance! 🌆 
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>   
            <p>
                
                Some of the key topics I picked up from today's property developer series on land was land acquisition, development, types of land 
                applications, sorts of things to look out for when acquiring land and the nightmares of Nutrient Neutrality (NN)!
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
            (For those who are unsure what NN is, it essentially ensures that development plans don't further worsen levels of nutrients within a catchment)
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
            It was interesting and insightful to hear professionals in the field talking about different land purchases and helping developers 
            upstart or improve their portfolios and giving top tips on minimising costs along the way.
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
            Alongside this event, I met some amazing and enthusiastic people and overall was a lovely evening!

                Today, I had the opportunity to visit the LSEG for the evening to meet like-minded peers and it was lovely to connect with so 
                many people and get an insight into what graduates do in their day to day lives! 📈
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
                We discovered about the different divisions and services they provide and this bought a new perspective into where I want to go with my

                and graduate roles!

            <h2>Lloyds Banking Group - Technology and Data Insight Day One (14.08.23):</h2>
            <p>On the same day I received my position as a Goodnotes ambassador, I attended a virtual insight day where 
                I discovered the ins and outs of being a Data scientist, analyst & business analyst and even had a go with
                 dealing issues that they work on everyday when on the job! Overall, it has been a fun experience and a nice 
                 refresher to the topics I learn from my first year statistics module in preparation for my econometrics module 
                 next year! Download the presentation we came up with on consumer behaviour with the button below!

            <h3>Lloyds Banking Group - Technology and Data Insight Day Two (15.08.23):</h3>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
                After another early start to the insight, we started exploring more technical roles which LBG offer in the world of 
                banking and we were also tasked several projects which involved presenting, planning and innovative thinking. In the 
                first presentation we pitched, I was 'thrown under the bus' as I was made to present our entire framework to a board of 
                people, however, I didn't mind this experience and was ready for the challenge! The second time, our pitch fostered a 5-year 
                plan of incorporating a new system which a bank could use to improve customer service and sustainability of our environment 
                (I did slides 2,3,4 & 5).
            </p>
            <p>‎</p>
            <p>
                I used my ESG and economic skills to help me create a plan which involved integrating blockchain 
                transactions into the world of banking, where I created the roadmap and reasons for how it would improve overall ESG performance 
                within the organisation. The presentation (in my opinion) was very professional, considering we completed it in about 45 minutes - 
                have a look at the presentation created through the download button below (I did slides 3,6,7 & 9)! Overall, it was a fun experience 
                which allowed me to enhance my presentation, communication/teamwork and leadership skills whilst networking with some lovely people 
                who were at different levels of University!

                 from a students' opinion). The experience was engaging and very different to anything I have done in the past; would totally recommend

            of module selection that they would have at University of East Anglia; since from the extent of my knowledge, the module selection system

            more specifically numerical and inductive reasoning and this was quite exciting as it was my first time doing these types of tests. They were 
            very interesting and were different to what I was expecting as I thought it would be more open-ended, however, they were all multiple choice or 
            true/false responses. Despite not needing to write, some of the questions were fairly challenging as it required me to analyse data and some charts
             looked intimidating at first, but after a while I adapted and they weren't too bad in the end.

            <p>
                In this two hour session, everyone played two roles: AM (asset manager) and IB (investment banker). 
                We were provided with brief overviews on what we would be doing on our jobs and were given a tour around 
                the UI. I started off as an AM and I must say, they threw us in the deep end as it was very intense, but 
                exciting at the same time. At the end of the first session, I had a positive portfolio and had staked some 
                profits from the 'market'! Then I moved onto becoming an IB, this didn't go so well for me, but noneoftheless 
                I still made a positive profit! The overall session was enjoyable and intense at the same time and I didn't end up 
                getting the most amazing scores, however, I came out 15th out of 56 overall which I am very happy about (since I was 
                going against people with a much better financial knowledge than me).
