        This short dissertation was very enjoyable to write as I decided to further delve into the area of Credit
        risk and how credit ratings and models affected the yield spreads of corporate bonds. This piece of work
        further allowed me to develop my interest for Credit Risk and was one of the main reasons why I am considering
        this area of finance as a potential career path.

        Analysing risk through using different methods such as the Black and Scholes model, utilising the S&P
        and Moody's ratings, or looking at pre-historic data and crises events were all very unique and interesting
        in evaluatining their impacts on how an investor determines their yield from a T-Fund. Overall, a great a 
        project to take on!
